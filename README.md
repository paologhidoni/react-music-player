# Music Player
I am building a music player using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I would like the music player to be able to stream tracks stored on a server, but eventually also interact with Spotify's API, stream music and retrieve metadata such as track info, artwork, music genre, genre-related playlists.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript


## User Stories

- [x] As a user interested in listening to some music, I want to see controls on the music player to play some music, stop, skip tracks and play random tracks.

- [] As a user listening to music on a mobile, I want to be able to access the music player from any device.

- [x] As a user interested in knowing more about a track/artist, I want to be able to click on a link to see the original source of the song and get more info.
  
- [x] As a user interested in sampling some music, I want to be able visualise the elapsed time in the song and click on the progress bar to skip to a certain time in the song. 

## Stretch Goals / Ideas

- [] Use the Music Player project to start learning React.js .

- [] Use the Music Player project to start learning about Node.js .

- [] Integrate the Spotify API.

- [] Dynamically change the layout of the music player depending on the musical genre played.
